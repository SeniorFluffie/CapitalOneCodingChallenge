# CapitalOneCodingChallenge
The CapitalOne challenge to check code merged into a build pipeline while analyzing comment-related statistics.

## Execution
The program can be run with the following command

```python scan.py```

However, it needs to be run using Python 3. If earlier versions of python are also installed on the system, please specify

```python3 scan.py```

## Operation
When the program is launched, the user will be prompted to enter a file path. 

This will be the location of the file to scan (a .txt in this example).

The paths ```./tests/test_java_1.txt```,  ```./tests/test_java_2.txt```, and  ```./tests/test_python_1.txt``` have been provided.
