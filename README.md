# CapitalOneCodingChallenge
The CapitalOne challenge to check code merged into a build pipeline while analyzing comment-related statistics.

## Execution
The program can be run with the following command

```python scan.py```

However, it needs to be run using Python 3. If earlier versions of python are also installed on the system, please specify

```python3 scan.py```

## Operation
When the program is launched, the user will be prompted to enter a file path. 

This will be the location of the file to scan (a .txt in this example).

The paths ```./tests/test_java_1.txt```,  ```./tests/test_java_2.txt```, and  ```./tests/test_python_1.txt``` have been provided.

## Script
A script has been provided to run the test cases.

By typing ```./scan.ssh``` in the main directory you can run the first test case.

By typing ```./scan.ssh 1``` you can run the second, and ```./scan.ssh 2``` for the third.
